Language-Arduino Uno Board
Contribution-Coding the design pattern
We created a pattern that appears like 8 concentric circles of in a rotating bar using RGB LEDs using
only 8 RGB LEDs using following list of items:Arduino Uno Board, 8 RGB LEDs,a DC ,motor,a DC power
supply.We create basic circuit as Common Anode 8 RGB LEDs are connected to the Arduino Uno board
separately from the anodes. Red, Green and Blue terminals of each LEDs are connected with each other
and connected with the Arduino with common 3 pins.And finally Software multiplexing is used to light the
LEDs.
